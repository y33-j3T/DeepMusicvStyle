# When Music Meets A.I.

### Official TF implementation of the paper: "Style-conditioned Music Generation"

#### ICME 2020 (oral)

Released on March 18, 2020.

## Description
This is a joint work with the Department of Music (University of Malaya). It presents a refinement to the vanilla formulation of Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) which allow users to condition the compositional style of music generated by the model. In our experiments, we trained our model on Bach chorales (JSB) and western folk tunes (NMD). At generation time, users can specify the model to generate music in the style of Bach or folk tunes. The datasets used in the experiment can be downloaded at [JSB](http://kern.humdrum.org/search?s=t&keyword=Bach%20Johann&fbclid=IwAR39fsc8gUWjN6eYAUkewldNkeV499lX0Ew6VP8Nrrd_T1T7plaIIIb5nFQ) and [NMD](http://www-etud.iro.umontreal.ca/~boulanni/icml2012).

Curious how music generated by our model sound? Feel free to visit [Generated Music Samples](https://bit.ly/3b5QYKW) and leave your feedbacks. 

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6.8
- tensorflow(gpu) 1.15.0
- tensorflow-probability 0.8.0
- pretty-midi 0.2.8  

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.

## Running the code
### Setup
Check _dataset.py_ in the dataset folder and put in the correct folder path for the MIDI files. Change the train/test split ratio as you desire. The output should be train/test pickle files for each style, i.e. with 2 styles, you should have 4 pickle files, train/test for style 1 and train/test for style 2.

### Training
Check _train.sh_ to tune the hyperparameters. For hyperparameters not in _train.sh_, please look into _model.py_. Those hyperparameters that are not in _train.sh_ are found to be have little impact on model's learning.

Description for hyperparameters (and values used in the paper) and options in _train.sh_:
```

train_set="jsb_train.pkl nmd_train.pkl"   # training dataset path, separate style with space
test_set="jsb_test.pkl nmd_test.pkl"      # testing dataset path, make sure style sequence is same as above

### Generating music
Run _generate.sh_ to generate music. Options are described as follows.
```
ckpt_path=vae_model/vae-epoch250          # path to saved model checkpoint
output_save_path=jsb_samples              # folder directory to save generated music
n_generations=20                          # number of music samples to generate
style=0                                   # style of music to generate, number corresponds to train_set style sequence in train.sh
output_type=all                           # output file type. midi=MIDI file, wav=WAV file, all=both
temperature=0.2                           # lower temperature gives more confident output
cont_dim=120                              # latent space size for z_c 
cat_dim=2                                 # number of styles (categorical dimension)
```
